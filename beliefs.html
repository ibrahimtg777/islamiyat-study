    <h2>ðŸ“– Detailed Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      Muslims believe in six fundamental articles of faith, which form the foundation of Islamic belief. These include belief in Allah, His angels, His revealed books, His prophets, the Day of Judgment, and Divine Decree. Each of these elements shapes a Muslimâ€™s understanding of the universe and their role within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Five Pillars of Islam are the practical expressions of faith. Shahadah is the declaration of belief in the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad (PBUH). Salah is the ritual prayer performed five times daily. Zakat is the giving of alms to the poor, Sawm is fasting during Ramadan, and Hajj is the pilgrimage to Makkah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tawhid emphasizes the absolute oneness of Allah, rejecting any form of polytheism. Akhirah reminds Muslims of their accountability in the afterlife, encouraging ethical behavior and spiritual mindfulness.
